# ### WARNING ################################################################
# ### Disabling Windows Update for a long period of time is a pretty dumb idea.
# ### If you do, you'll end up way behind on security updates and you're Gonna
# ### Have A Bad Timeâ„¢. This script is intended for users who need to
# ### occasionally, and temporarily, disable updates to ensure a specific task
# ### doesn't get interrupted by updates. When that task is complete, the user
# ### should return the update service to normal. This script is designed
# ### around this use case.
# ############################################################################
#
# Usage: suspend_windows_update.ps1
#
# Temporarily disables the Windows Update service by stopping and setting its
# startup type to disabled. Then waits indefinitely for a keystroke, after
# which the service is re-enabled.
#
# When toggling the service off, it stops the service if it's running, and
# sets its startup type to disabled.
#
# Stuff that happens when Windows Update service is disabled:
#  - No notification of new updates
#  - No new updates will be downloaded
#  - A scheduled restart for already downloaded updates will not occur
#  - The "Check for updates" button in the "Update & Security" > "Windows
#    Update" section of the Settings app will report an error and offer a
#    "Retry" button that also won't work until the service is enabled again.
#
# When toggling the service back on, the script sets the service's startup
# type to it's default: manual, but doesn't start the service (it will start
# on it's own as needed).

# Check to be sure we're running as admin, and bail if we're not.
